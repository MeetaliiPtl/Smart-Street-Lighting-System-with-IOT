# Smart-Street-Lighting-System-with-IOT
Street lighting is a crucial part of any city or urban area, providing safety and convenience for pedestrians and drivers during the night. However, traditional street lighting systems consume a significant amount of energy, contributing to environmental issues and increasing energy costs. To address this challenge, smart street lighting systems have emerged as a potential solution. These systems use advanced technology to conserve energy by turning on lights only when necessary.

In this project, we have developed a smart street lighting system using Arduino, ultrasonic sensor, LDR, NodeMCU, and ESP8266. The system utilizes ultrasonic sensors to detect the presence of objects in the vicinity and LDR to detect the light level. This information is sent to an Arduino microcontroller, which processes the data and triggers the streetlights to turn on or off accordingly.

# ThingSpeak
ThingSpeak™ is an IoT analytics platform service that allows you to aggregate, visualize, and analyze live data streams. Once you send data to ThingSpeak from your devices, you can create instant visualizations of live data without having to write any code. With MATLAB® analytics inside ThingSpeak, you can write and execute MATLAB code to perform more advanced preprocessing, visualizations, and analyses.
